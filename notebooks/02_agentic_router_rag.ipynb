    "# Agentic Router RAG with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build an agentic RAG system that can route queries to the appropriate data source, including web search for current information. This solves some of the limitations we saw in the basic RAG approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Agentic Router RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Router RAG adds an intelligent routing layer that:\n",
    "1. **Analyzes the query** to understand the user's intent\n",
    "2. **Routes to the appropriate data source** (catalog, FAQ, troubleshooting, or web search)\n",
    "3. **Retrieves relevant documents** from the correct collection or searches the web\n",
    "4. **Generates contextual answers** using only relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand how query routing works in RAG systems\n",
    "- Connect to multiple ChromaDB collections, for different types of data\n",
    "- Integrate web search for current information using Tavily\n",
    "- Build a router node that classifies query intent\n",
    "- Create conditional workflows in LangGraph\n",
    "- Compare router RAG performance with basic RAG"

      "Both laptops are ultra-lightweight, making them effortless to carry in your backpack.

Their port selection also covers everything a student usually needs.\n",

      "**For the UltraBook Pro (SKU001):**  \n",
      "Symptoms: Battery indicator drops from 100% to 70% in under an hour of web browsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try the following steps:\n",
      "1. Switch Windows power mode to 'Balanced'.\n",

      "**1. Check for Faulty Drivers and Hardware Conflicts**\n",
      "- Driver issues are a common cause. Try rebooting your computer and pressing **F8** to boot into **VGA Mode** or **Safe Mode**. If the system boots successfully in this mode, it's likely that a faulty video (graphics) driver is causing the problem (Source: community.spiceworks.com).\n",
      "    - Update or roll back your display/video drivers via Device Manager.\n",

      "\n",
      "**4. Check for Conflicts with Security Software**\n",
      "- Some users have reported issues with certain security programs, especially those involving virtual drivers (e.g., Vanguard anti-cheat). If you recently installed such software, try uninstalling it (Source: learn.microsoft.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Update BIOS and Windows**\n",
      "- Hardware/firmware conflicts may also play a role. Visit your PC or motherboard manufacturer's support page to check for BIOS or chipset updates, especially if you're not using Bitlocker (Source: learn.microsoft.com).\n",

    "## Comparison: Router RAG vs Basic RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare how Router RAG improves upon Basic RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Router RAG Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent-Aware Routing**: Queries are automatically classified and routed to the most relevant collection\n",
    "2. **Focused Context**: Only relevant documents are retrieved, eliminating noise from unrelated collections\n",
    "3. **Domain Expertise**: Each collection can be optimized for its specific domain (products, support, policies)\n",
    "4. **Better Precision**: Reduced false positives from semantically similar but contextually irrelevant documents\n",
    "5. **Cleaner Answers**: Responses are more focused and less confused by mixed context types\n",
    "6. **Integration with Multiple Data Sources / Web Search**: Current information retrieval for troubleshooting issues not in our database\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Router RAG Excels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain-Specific Questions**: \"What laptops do you have?\" → Direct to catalog\n",
    "- **Policy Questions**: \"How do returns work?\" → Direct to FAQ\n",
    "- **Technical Support**: \"Screen flickering issue\" → Direct to troubleshooting\n",
    "- **Current Information**: \"Windows 11 blue screen error\" → Direct to web search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remaining Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Domain & Multi-Hop Queries**: Questions spanning multiple collections, or needing multple steps.\n",
    "- **Router Accuracy**: Misclassification by the router can lead to searching the wrong collection\n",
    "- **Noisy Documents within a Collection**: Even when querying a single index, the retriever can still return noisy / irrelevant documents.\n"
