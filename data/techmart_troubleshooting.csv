The battery percentage does not increase, and the laptop may only operate on AC power. The charging LED near the USB-C port may not illuminate.","1. Check that the USB-C charger is securely connected to both the laptop and a working power outlet. 
2. Try plugging the charger into the other Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) port to rule out a faulty port. 
3. Inspect the charging cable and adapter for visible damage or loose connections. 
4. Disconnect the charger, power off the laptop, and hold the power button for 15 seconds. Then reconnect the charger and power on the device. 
5. In Windows, right-click the battery icon and select 'Power & sleep settings' > 'Additional power settings.' Ensure the selected plan does not restrict charging. 
6. Open Device Manager, expand 'Batteries,' right-click 'Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery,' and select 'Uninstall device.' Restart the laptop—Windows will reinstall the driver automatically. 
7. If the issue persists, test with a compatible USB-C charger (65W or higher). 
8. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact TechMart support for further assistance, as the battery or charging circuit may need inspection."
